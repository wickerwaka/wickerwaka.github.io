The F2 is an arcade system developed by Taito and used for over a dozen games released between 1988 and 1993. It is based around a Motorola 68000 as it&amp;rsquo;s main CPU and a Zilog Z80 for audio, a very popular pairing at the time. I have been a fan of both of these processors for a long time since the Z80 based ZX Spectrum and 68000 based Atari ST were my first computers."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=http://wickerwaka.github.io/posts/taito_f2/><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=http://wickerwaka.github.io/style.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=http://wickerwaka.github.io/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=http://wickerwaka.github.io/img/favicon.png><link href=/fonts/Inter-Italic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Medium.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-MediumItalic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-BoldItalic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="http://wickerwaka.github.io/"><meta name=twitter:title content="Taito F2"><meta name=twitter:description content="I have decided that I'm going to reverse engineer the Taito F2 arcade system and develop a MiSTer FPGA core for it."><meta property="og:title" content="Taito F2"><meta property="og:description" content="I have decided that I'm going to reverse engineer the Taito F2 arcade system and develop a MiSTer FPGA core for it."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="http://wickerwaka.github.io/posts/taito_f2/"><meta property="og:image" content="http://wickerwaka.github.io/"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2023-06-02T06:20:52-07:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2023-06-02T06:20:52-07:00"></head><body class=dark-theme><div class=container><header class=header><span class=header__inner><a href=/ class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>devblog.txt</span>

I have decided that I&rsquo;m going to reverse engineer the Taito F2 arcade system and develop a MiSTer FPGA core for it.</p><p>The F2 is an arcade system developed by Taito and used for over a dozen games released between 1988 and 1993. It is based around a Motorola 68000 as it&rsquo;s main CPU and a Zilog Z80 for audio, a very popular pairing at the time. I have been a fan of both of these processors for a long time since the Z80 based ZX Spectrum and 68000 based Atari ST were my first computers. For me, these processors define 8-bit and 16-bit computing.</p><p>Unlike the IREM M72 and M92 systems (which are the only other arcade boards I have experience with) the Taito F2 uses very few discreet logic ICs. The system uses a collection of custom ICs. Some of those customs are common to all games and the rest are used based on the needs of each game.</p><p>Games come in both single board and dual board form factors. In the dual board form factor the &ldquo;Mother PCB&rdquo; contains the CPUs, sound hardware, most of the RAM and the common custom ICs that handle sprite and tilemap drawing. The &ldquo;Game PCB&rdquo; contains the ROMs and any custom ICs the game needs.</p><p>I currently own a single board <em>Final Blow</em> PCB. It is the earliest F2 game as well as one of the cheapest and most readily available. Most importantly there are also <a href=https://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/F/FinalBlow.sch.pdf>schematics</a> available for it. Really nice schematics actually. They are clearly labeled and provide a lot of valuable information about the custom ICs.</p><p>My plan is to create a test ROM similar to the one I built for the M92 boards. This ROM will allow me to send test signals to the custom ICs and analyze the results with a scope, logic analyzer or just &ldquo;looking at the screen.&rdquo; Later on this test ROM will also be useful for validating core behavior vs original hardware.</p></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user">Â© 2023 Martin Donlon</div></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.js></script></div></body></html>
